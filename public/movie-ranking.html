<h1>The Best Movies According to Charles</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This has it all. Exploration, human connection, beautiful filmography and the score to match.</p>
<h3>Dune (by Villeneuve)</h3>
<p>What started it all. No further comment necessary</p>
<h3>The Prestige</h3>
<p>Another Nolan (!!) movie that I love. I've watched it too many times to count</p>
